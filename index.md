## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2

  This was my most favorite lab because not only did I learn how to play blackjack,
  but I also learned how to utilize the command line. It was tricky trying to be
  accustomed to indexing (starting from 0), which made me spend an unnecessarily
  long time on an error if condition statement. However, in all of the labs I have done,
  this one helped me be a better problem solver. After the lab was completed, it all
  came together like a beautiful composition; it was neat tracing how the
  compound boolean functions, string to integers, and integer functions came together to
  make a program that allowed me to play blackjack with the computer!

* Lab 3, Part 2

  This lab made me realize the real-life usage of programming the most. Calculating the
  number of days between two dates like “how many days till x,” is a problem we face when
  we try to plan for an event. Naturally, it is only right that making a program that finds
  the number of days in between would be the lab that makes me appreciate the improved
  quality of life programs offer. This lab also acquainted me with how many calculations a
  variable can handle in an expression; the example being a function named Julian Day. I
  remember I kept telling myself, “No way this expression is too big!” In the end, this
  program worked as intended. Compared to other programs made in labs, I use this one the
  most because it is so useful!

* Lab 4, Part 1

  Continuing the real-world application of programming as in Lab 3 Part 2, is this lab
  where my partner and I worked on conversion ratios. I found this lab as my realization
  of personal life, and programming life conversing into one; passing arguments to other
  functions felt like two LEGO blocks connecting in which I love LEGOS! Calling different
  functions, changing variables, and returning variables reminded me of the delicate,
  procedural process of building LEGO Starwars spaceships in my youth. I loved this lab
  because it reminded me that technology is where I want my career in!
